        answer: (<>
            We can make adjustments to your purchase before the manufacturing process begins. The project may need to be re-estimated depending on the nature of your proposed adjustments, in which case you will get an updated quotation.
            <br />
            Please bear in mind that custom printed things are one-of-a-kind and cannot be reused. In some circumstances, it may be possible to cancel an order throughout the various stages of production, however, cancellation costs will apply based on the quantity and nature of the work that has already been completed. Our customer service agents will educate you of any cancellation expenses. Once an order has completed the fabricating preparation and entered the shipment stage, it cannot be cancelled.
